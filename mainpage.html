			<p>Welcome to the 2018 HP Sand Volleyball League! As you can see, we have a new website! I'm continuosly working on the site so if things break it's probably because I'm working on something and things will get fixed quickly. Please be patient.</p>
			<p>Right now we have <a href="signup">signups</a> working and you can enter your <a href="fto">schedule restrictions</a> once you've signed up. To navigate, use the menu at the top of the page. Go ahead and log in using your Google account, then sign up by providing your name, notification email, and phone number. You phone number won't be shared. We may use SMS for updates and last-minute changes, so if you don't want SMS messages, don't provide your phone number.</p>
			<p>This year will be a bit different from previous years. In order to accomodate players of all levels of ability, we are implementing a tier system. Players will be seeded into tiers based on last year's results. Each week, the top two players in each tier will move up a tier. The bottom two will move down a tier. This should create a self-correcting system that allows everyone to play and contribute at their level of skill. New players will start at the bottom.</p>
			<p>There will be player rankings roughly based on the Elo method. These rankings are separate from the tier system, although they should roughly correlate.</p>
			<p>I have not decided what to do for the end of the season. We could take the top 24 players again and draft teams and play a season-ending tournament, or we could play the regular season for a few more weeks, or maybe even something else entirely. I'm open to suggestions.</P>
			<p>Here's to an amazing season!<br>
