			<p>Welcome to the 2018 HP Sand Volleyball League! As you can see, we have a new website! I'm continuosly working on the site so if things break it's probably because I'm working on something and things will get fixed quickly. Please be patient.</p>
			<p>Right now we have <a href="signup">signups</a> working and you can enter your <a href="fto">schedule restrictions</a> once you've signed up. To navigate, use the menu at the top of the page. Go ahead and log in using your Google account, then sign up by providing your name, notification email, and phone number. You phone number won't be visible to anyone else or shared. We may use SMS for updates and last-minute changes, so if you don't want SMS messages, don't provide your phone number.</p>
			<p class="bg-info">The <a href="week">Schedule</a> and <a href="day">Scores</a> pages are now active. On the <a href="week">Schedule</a> page, click on a day to see the game schedule and score entry form. The weekly schedule should automatically generate at 2pm on Fridays. So be sure to get your scores into the system right after your match. Especially on Fridays. Eventually I hope that the system will send out meeting requests automatically when the schedule is generated. For now, I'll probably be doing that manually. Finally, be sure to have your FTO/conflicts in the system before the schedule generates on Friday. Otherwise you may be scheduled for a match you can't make.</p>
			<p class="bg-info"><strong>Subs:</strong> If you cannot make a match, contact me. If we can find a sub from the same tier who is available to play, we can make the official switch in the system (I think). Otherwise, your position will go unfilled, your team will probably lose, and you will end up relegated down a tier.
			<p>This year will be a bit different from previous years. In order to accomodate players of all levels of ability, we are implementing a tier system. Players will be seeded into tiers based on last year's results. Each week, the top two players in each tier will move up a tier. The bottom two will move down a tier. This should create a self-correcting system that allows everyone to play and contribute at their level of skill. New players will start at the bottom.</p>
			<p>There will be player rankings roughly based on the ELO method. These rankings are separate from the tier system, although they should roughly correlate. Eventually. The rankings page will come later.</p>
			<p>I have not decided what to do for the end of the season. I'm open to suggestions. I hear Suzie Dustin is donating a $100 gift card as a prize! Woot!</p>
			<p>Here's to an amazing season!<br>
